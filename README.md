# Roblox State Framework

# Overview

The Roblox State Framework is a modular system designed to help developers manage and organize game states within Roblox Studio projects. States are fundamental to controlling the flow and behavior of games, and this framework provides a flexible and efficient way to implement them.

## Features

Easy state management: Quickly switch between different game states.
Customizable state behaviors: Define unique actions and properties for each state.
Modular design: Add or remove states easily to suit your game's needs.
Event-driven architecture: Execute specific actions when entering or exiting states.

# Usage

## Setup
Import the StateFramework module into your Roblox Studio project.
Require the StateFramework module in your scripts where you need to manage states.
```lua
Copy code
local StateFramework = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("StateFramework"))
Define States
lua
Copy code
-- Define states using a table with state names as keys and state functions as values.
local states = {
    Idle = function()
        -- Define behavior for the Idle state
        print("Entering Idle state")
    end,
    Running = function()
        -- Define behavior for the Running state
        print("Entering Running state")
    end,
    Jumping = function()
        -- Define behavior for the Jumping state
        print("Entering Jumping state")
    end
}

-- Initialize the state machine with the defined states
local stateMachine = StateFramework.new(states)
Transition Between States
lua
Copy code
-- Set the current state to Idle
stateMachine:SetState("Idle")

-- Transition to the Running state
stateMachine:SetState("Running")

-- Transition to the Jumping state
stateMachine:SetState("Jumping")
Event Handling
lua
Copy code
-- Register a callback function to execute when entering the Jumping state
stateMachine:OnStateEnter("Jumping", function()
    print("Executing Jumping state enter callback")
end)

-- Register a callback function to execute when exiting the Running state
stateMachine:OnStateExit("Running", function()
    print("Executing Running state exit callback")
end)
```
